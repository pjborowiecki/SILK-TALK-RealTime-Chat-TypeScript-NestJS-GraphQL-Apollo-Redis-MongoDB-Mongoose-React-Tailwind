# SilkTalk Real-Time Chat

This portfolio project focuses on building a real-world, full-stack chatting application with scalability and production-grade quality. The backend is developed using NestJS, a Node.js library, featuring a GraphQL API for CRUD operations and MongoDB for data storage. Real-time messaging subscriptions are facilitated through WebSocket connections, with JWT authentication adhearing to industry standards and ensuring security.

On the front end, a React app is crafted using TailwindCSS and ShadcnUI for responsive UI design. Apollo Client is employed for state management, enabling seamless interaction with the GraphQL API and efficient data caching.

The project is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amplify, supported by a continuous delivery CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.

# SilkTalk Real-Time Chat

This portfolio project focuses on building a real-world, full-stack chatting application with scalability and production-grade quality.

The backend is developed using NestJS, a Node.js library, featuring a GraphQL API for CRUD operations and MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage.

Zod and Joi are used for input validation, on the client and server respectively.

Real-time messaging subscriptions are facilitated through WebSocket connections.

Authentication is implemented using Passport.js and HTTP-only JWT cookies, adhearing to industry standards and ensuring security.

On the front end, a React app is crafted using Vite, TailwindCSS and ShadcnUI for responsive UI design.

Routing is achieved with TanStack Router. Apollo Client is also employed, enabling seamless interaction with the GraphQL API and efficient data caching.

My preferred weapon of choice for developing user interfaces is generally Next.js, but I decied to use plain React to showcase my verstility and proficciency in both.

The project is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amplify, supported by a continuous delivery CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.

# SilkTalk Real-Time Chat

This portfolio project focuses on building a real-world, full-stack chatting application with scalability and production-grade quality.

The backend is developed using NestJS, a Node.js library, featuring a GraphQL API for CRUD operations and MongoDB for data storage. Real-time messaging subscriptions are facilitated through WebSocket connections, with JWT authentication adhearing to industry standards and ensuring security.

On the front end, a React app is crafted using Vite, TailwindCSS and ShadcnUI for responsive UI design. Routing is achieved with TanStack Router. Apollo Client is also employed, enabling seamless interaction with the GraphQL API and efficient data caching. My preferred weapon of choice for developing user interfaces is generally Next.js, but I decied to use plain React to showcase my verstility and proficciency in both.

The project is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amplify, supported by a continuous delivery CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.
